'''
two new functions in this file: argQty(inputree,errLog)->bool and typeCheck(inputTree, errLog)
CAUTION:  (+ (+ 3 #t) 4 5) should give two errors. so do both before recursing to future nodes.

only need to check in the case in which parent is ( and child[0] is a function.
i.e. (1...) doesn't matter, and (if #t + *) doesn't matter for the + (but it does for the if)
best way is to check the inputs/type WHEN you hit the (
note: be sure to subtract one from the length of the children (to acct for the fact that child0=the function)

check number of inputs vs what's allowable.
(+ 4 5 6) should produce an error msg (i.e. appended to errLog) "+ only takes 2 arguments, but 3 were provided"

check types of those inputs
(+ 3 #f) should produce an error msgs "+ should have argument #2 as an int but a bool was provided"
